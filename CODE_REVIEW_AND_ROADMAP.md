## üîç CODE REVIEW FINDINGS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES FOUND (PRIORITY ORDER)

#### üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES

**1. Orphaned Cascade Delete Risk (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Location**: `User.java` lines 68-76
- **Issue**: Using `CascadeType.ALL` on `@OneToMany` relationships
```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<Topic> topics = new ArrayList<>();
```
- **Problem**: If a user is deleted, ALL their topics/posts are deleted, which could destroy valuable forum content
- **Best Practice**: Change to `CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE` or handle deletion separately
- **Fix**: Keep user content when user is deleted or implement soft delete

**2. Missing Transaction Management**
- **Location**: Several service methods
- **Issue**: Some complex operations lack `@Transactional` annotation
- **Impact**: Potential data inconsistency if operations fail mid-process
- **Fix**: Add `@Transactional` to all service methods that modify data

**3. No Input Sanitization for HTML Content**
- **Location**: Post/Comment creation
- **Issue**: User-submitted content could contain XSS attacks
- **Risk**: Security vulnerability
- **Fix**: Implement HTML sanitization library (JSoup or OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer)

#### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

**4. Missing Lombok**
- **Issue**: Lots of boilerplate getters/setters in entities
- **Impact**: Code maintainability and readability
- **Fix**: Add Lombok dependency and use `@Data`, `@Builder`, etc.

**5. No Proper Exception Handling**
- **Issue**: Generic exception handling, no global exception handler
- **Location**: Controllers throw generic exceptions
- **Fix**: Implement `@ControllerAdvice` with custom exception classes

**6. Hardcoded Values**
- **Issue**: Magic numbers and strings throughout code
- **Examples**: Page sizes, validation lengths
- **Fix**: Extract to constants or application.properties

**7. No Pagination DTOs**
- **Issue**: Returning Page<Entity> directly to views
- **Impact**: Exposes internal implementation details
- **Fix**: Create pagination wrapper DTOs

**8. Missing Service Interfaces**
- **Issue**: Some services have interfaces, some don't (inconsistent)
- **Fix**: All services should have interfaces for better testability and abstraction

**9. No Caching**
- **Issue**: Frequently accessed data (categories, popular topics) hit DB every time
- **Impact**: Performance
- **Fix**: Implement Spring Cache with Redis or Caffeine

**10. Missing API Documentation**
- **Issue**: No Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Fix**: Add SpringDoc OpenAPI dependency

#### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY / ENHANCEMENTS

**11. No Unit Tests**
- **Issue**: Only one test file exists (empty)
- **Fix**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

**12. No Logging Strategy**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent logging, missing log levels
- **Fix**: Implement proper logging with SLF4J/Logback

**13. N+1 Query Problem Potential**
- **Issue**: Lazy loading without fetch joins could cause N+1 queries
- **Fix**: Add `@EntityGraph` or fetch joins where needed

**14. No Rate Limiting**
- **Issue**: No protection against spam or DOS attacks
- **Fix**: Implement rate limiting with Bucket4j or similar

**15. Inconsistent Naming Conventions**
- **Issue**: Some methods use `get*`, others use `find*`
- **Fix**: Standardize naming conventions
